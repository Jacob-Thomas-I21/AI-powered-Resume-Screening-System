# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project automates the resume screening process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The system extracts key information from resumes, ranks candidates based on job descriptions, and provides an AI-driven candidate shortlisting system.

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Progress

âœ… Phase 1: Data Preprocessing (Completed)

âœ… Step 1: Loaded Resume Dataset  
âœ… Step 2: Dropped Unnecessary Columns  
âœ… Step 3: Handled Missing Data  
âœ… Step 4: Cleaned Resume Text (Clean_Resume column)

âœ… Phase 2: Feature Extraction (Completed)

âœ… Step 5: Tokenization & Stopword Removal  
âœ… Step 6: Skill Extraction (NER)  
âœ… Step 7: Convert Text to Numerical Vectors (SBERT)  

âœ… Model Training & Resume Ranking (Completed)  
âœ… API & Deployment (In Progress)

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Resume Parsing â€“ Extracts structured information from PDF & DOCX resumes.  
âœ… Text Preprocessing â€“ Tokenization, stopword removal, Named Entity Recognition (NER).  
âœ… Skill Extraction â€“ Identifies relevant skills (Python, Java, Machine Learning, etc.).  
âœ… AI Model for Candidate Ranking â€“ Uses SBERT embeddings + MLP + XGBoost to match resumes to job descriptions.  
âœ… Deployment Ready â€“ Prepares FastAPI service for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Docker (if deploying in containers)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-screening.git
cd resume-screening

Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ“Œ New Process - Add/Change Job Description
ðŸ†• Adding or Updating Job Description

    Run the new script:

    python update_job_description.py

    Paste the new job description when prompted.
    This will: âœ… Save job_description.csv
    âœ… Precompute & save job_embedding.npy
    âœ… Precompute & save job_skills.pkl

ðŸ”„ What to Do After Updating Job Description?

    Re-run Data Preprocessing for All Resumes:

python data_preprocessing,_skill_extraction_&_sbert_embeddings.py

Retrain the Models:

    python resume_match_deployment.py

ðŸ“Œ Process for New Resumes (Same Job Description)

    Add new resumes to your folder.
    Re-run:

    python data_preprocessing,_skill_extraction_&_sbert_embeddings.py
    python resume_match_deployment.py

ðŸ“Œ Process for New Resumes (Single Prediction After Deployment)

    After deployment, if a single new resume arrives, you donâ€™t need to retrain the entire model.
    Use:

    python predict_resume_match.py /path/to/new_resume.pdf

    This loads existing models and gives a result immediately.

ðŸ“Œ Running the API

Once fully trained and processed, you can run:

uvicorn api:app --reload

This serves the AI as a REST API for real-time predictions.
